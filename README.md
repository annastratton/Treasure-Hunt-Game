# Treasure Hunt Game Notebook Readme

## Introduction
Welcome to the Treasure Hunt Game Notebook! This readme file provides an overview of the code and instructions within this notebook. In this project, you will be working on implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm to create an intelligent agent (a pirate) that can find the treasure in a maze before it.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to complete the deep Q-learning implementation for the pirate agent. The agent will learn how to navigate a maze to find the treasure while maximizing its reward. The provided code includes Python classes and functions to help you with this task.

## Code Structure
The notebook is divided into sections that explain various aspects of the project and provide code blocks to help you complete the implementation. Here's a brief overview of the key sections:

1. **Read and Review Your Starter Code**: This section introduces the project theme and provides an overview of the code you've been given, including the two main Python classes: `TreasureMaze` and `GameExperience`.

2. **Maze Representation**: This section defines the maze, which is represented as an 8x8 matrix. You'll find code to visualize the maze and the pirate's position within it.

3. **Agent Actions and Exploration**: This section explains how the pirate agent can move in four directions (left, right, up, and down) and introduces the concept of exploration (controlled by the exploration factor `epsilon`) versus exploitation.

4. **Functions for Game Simulation**: This section provides functions for simulating a game based on a trained model, checking if the pirate can win any game, and building the neural network model.

5. **Deep Q-learning Implementation**: This is the core section where you'll implement the deep Q-learning algorithm. The pseudocode is provided as a starting point, and you'll need to complete the implementation to train the pirate agent.

6. **Test Your Model**: This section guides you through testing your deep Q-learning model. You'll visualize the maze, build and train the model, and check if it passes the completion check. Finally, you'll test the model in one game scenario.

7. **Save and Submit Your Work**: Instructions on how to save your work, include your name in the filename, and submit it for grading are provided in this section.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions in each section of the notebook. Make sure to complete the deep Q-learning implementation in Section 5 to train the pirate agent effectively. Test your model as described in Section 6 to ensure it can navigate the maze and find the treasure.

Good luck, and have fun implementing your pirate agent!
